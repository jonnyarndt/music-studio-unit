ERROR HANDLING BEST PRACTICES
----------------------------------------
1. Catch Specific Exceptions:
   - Use specific exception types instead of generic Exception
   - Handle each exception type appropriately

2. Always Log Exceptions:
   - Include exception details, stack trace, and context
   - Use structured logging for better analysis

3. Implement Recovery Strategies:
   - Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
   - Provide fallback mechanisms and default values
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies

4. Resource Management:
   - Use using statements for disposable resources
   - Implement proper cleanup in finally blocks

5. Async Error Handling:
   - Use async Task instead of async void
   - Handle AggregateException properly
   - Use cancellation tokens for long-running operations
