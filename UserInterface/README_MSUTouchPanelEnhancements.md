**Join Allocation**:
- Music Screen: 411-491 (80 joins)
- Combine Screen: 421-481 (60 joins)
- Menu Bar: 481-490 (shared)
- Connection Status: 491-499

### 5. Enhanced MSUTouchPanel.cs
**Purpose**: Main touchpanel controller integrating all enhanced screens

**Enhancements**:
- Integration of MusicScreenUI and CombineScreenUI
- StudioCombinationManager integration
- Enhanced event handling for all screen types
- Proper initialization and disposal patterns
- Navigation coordination between screens

**Navigation Flow**:
1. Settings screen on boot (per Client-Scope.md)
2. Menu bar navigation to all five functions
3. Back navigation support
4. State preservation across page changes
