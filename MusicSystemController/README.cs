/*
 * Enhanced Music System Controller Implementation - Complete System
 * Based on Client-Scope.md Appendix C: QuirkyTech Digital Music System
 * 
 * This implementation provides complete music browsing and playback functionality:
 * 
 * 1. PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE (Client-Scope.md Appendix C):
 *    - ASCII command protocol with CR LF terminators
 *    - Artist catalog browsing with pagination (max 10 per request)
 *    - Track listing by artist with pagination support
 *    - Play/Stop commands with MSU UID identification
 *    - Binary time feedback via separate TCP server connection
 *    - Proper response parsing and error handling
 * 
 * 2. CATALOG BROWSING:
 *    - Dynamic artist count retrieval: "QDMS ARTIST COUNT?"
 *    - Artist listing with pagination: "QDMS LIST ARTIST START <ss> END <ee>"
 *    - Track count per artist: "QDMS ARTIST <aaa> TRACK COUNT?"
 *    - Track listing by artist: "QDMS LIST ARTIST <aaa> TRACK START <ss> END <ee>"
 *    - Artist/track name parsing with regex validation
 *    - Cached catalog data for performance
 * 
 * 3. PLAYBACK CONTROL:
 *    - Track playback: "QDMS PLAY <tttt> FOR <msu_uid> SEND <ip> START"
 *    - Track stopping: "QDMS STOP <tttt> FOR <msu_uid>"
 *    - MSU UID from processor MAC address (per Client-Scope.md)
 *    - IP address discovery for feedback connection
 *    - Playback state management and event handling
 * 
 * 4. TIME FEEDBACK HANDLING:
 *    - Dedicated TCP server for time counter reception
 *    - Binary packet parsing: [51][51][51]<lsb><msb>[03]
 *    - 16-bit remaining time calculation from LSB/MSB
 *    - Real-time UI updates with formatted time display
 *    - Automatic track completion detection (time = 0)
 * 
 * 5. TOUCH PANEL INTEGRATION:
 *    - Artist list browsing with pagination (10 per page)
 *    - Track list browsing by selected artist
 *    - Now playing screen with playback controls
 *    - Real-time time remaining display
 *    - Connection status indicators
 *    - Error message display system
 * 
 * 6. CONNECTION MANAGEMENT:
 *    - Enhanced TCP client with proper async receive
 *    - Command/response synchronization with timeout
 *    - Connection loss detection and event handling
 *    - Automatic reconnection support
 *    - Error recovery and user feedback
 * 
 * Files created:
 * - EnhancedMusicSystemController.cs: Main controller with full DMS protocol
 * - TcpCoreClient.cs: Enhanced TCP client with async data handling
 * - MusicDataModels.cs: Data structures and event argument classes
 * - MusicBrowseUI.cs: Touch panel integration for music browsing
 * - ControlSystem.cs: Updated with music system initialization
 * 
 * Key protocol commands implemented:
 * ✓ QDMS ARTIST COUNT? - Get total artist count
 * ✓ QDMS LIST ARTIST START <ss> END <ee> - Get artist range
 * ✓ QDMS ARTIST <aaa> TRACK COUNT? - Get track count for artist
 * ✓ QDMS LIST ARTIST <aaa> TRACK START <ss> END <ee> - Get track range
 * ✓ QDMS PLAY <tttt> FOR <msu_uid> SEND <ip> START - Start playback
 * ✓ QDMS STOP <tttt> FOR <msu_uid> - Stop playback
 * ✓ Binary time feedback parsing - Real-time remaining time
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * 
 * // In ControlSystem.cs InitializeSystem():
 * var dmsConfig = new DMSInfo
 * {
 *     IP = "10.0.0.200",              // DMS server IP
 *     Port = 4010,                   // Command port
 *     ListenPort = 4011,             // Time feedback port
 *     AutoReconnect = true
 * };
 * 
 * string msuUID = GetMacAddressUID(); // MAC address as UID
 * var musicController = new EnhancedMusicSystemController("MainMusic", dmsConfig, msuUID);
 * var musicUI = new MusicBrowseUI(musicController, touchPanel);
 * 
 * if (musicController.Initialize())
 * {
 *     // Load catalog and start browsing
 *     musicController.LoadMusicCatalog();
 * }
 * 
 * Touch panel joins used:
 * - 201-203: Artist/Track/Now Playing subpages
 * - 211-220: Artist selection buttons (10 per page)
 * - 221-230: Artist name displays
 * - 231-233: Artist pagination controls
 * - 241-250: Track selection buttons (10 per page)
 * - 251-260: Track name displays
 * - 261-264: Track pagination and navigation
 * - 301-307: Now playing controls and displays
 * - 310-311: Connection status and error messages
 * 
 * Console commands added:
 * - musicstatus: Display current system status and playback info
 * - musicrefresh: Reload catalog from DMS server
 * - playtrack <id>: Start playback of specific track
 * - stoptrack: Stop current playback
 * 
 * Error handling features:
 * - Response timeout management (5 seconds)
 * - Malformed response detection
 * - Connection loss recovery
 * - User-friendly error messages
 * - Debug logging with multiple levels
 * 
 * Performance optimizations:
 * - Catalog caching to reduce DMS queries
 * - Paginated loading (10 items per request max)
 * - Async TCP operations to prevent blocking
 * - Event-driven UI updates for responsiveness
 * 
 * This implementation fully satisfies the Client-Scope.md requirements for
 * digital music system integration with artist/track browsing, playback
 * control, and real-time time feedback handling.
